STORY- I want to make a game on preventing the currption in 
India and in world which can be stopped by young 
generation in politics gradually change these rules and 
regulations..

1 or 2 currupt politicians , gang of demand for justice 
people
main player- politicianS
secendary player- gang of people for justice

PC- politicians
NPC- gang of people for justice

Goal- the young generations in politics should 
overcome this rules and regulations and change it 
gradually.

Rules- 1) Politicians should touch a person in a gang 
and get more currpted.
           2) As Games moves the gang should become 
strong and politician cannot destroy the any person and 
end up with destroying a politician.
             3) Then game becomes sucessful.

Feedback- There should be written feedback for harder
levels to be cleared.

Chance vs Skill- It should be taken as a chance not a 
skill.

Adaptivity- Adaptivity should be low.

Balance- The games become difficult as a currupt
 politician cannot kill more people after few minutes 
and end up destroying himself. Hence in this way game 
finishes.
